# ICT5101 - Internet of Things

## Project Details

#### Title: Developing a Remote Plant Monitoring System using IoT

Created in fulfilment of the requirements for the ICT5101 Internet of Things assignment by [Oleg Grech](https://github.com/oleggrech7).

## Abstract

In a time of rapidly advancing technology, the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has transformed several sectors in the world we live in, especially in the agriculture sector. This report explores building a prototype for a remote plant monitoring system using IoT technology. The system uses an Arduino UNO R4 WiFi board to collect data and transmit the data wirelessly, where the obtained readings are displayed on a web interface developed using Next.js. This project contains the developed Arduino and web interface code, along with the datasheets of the components used and the report.

## Running both applications

A **README** file has been included in both the _arduino-remote-plant-monitor-system_ and _web-application_ folders with the necessary instructions to run both projects.
